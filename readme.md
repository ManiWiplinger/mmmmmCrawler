# Crawler mmmmmCrawler
Crawler using jsoup lib for crawling links from a homepage on a working javafx GUI.

## How to run
Build and run LandinPage ``` src/main/java/at/ac/fhcampuswien/coffescript/mmmmmcrawler/LandingPage.java```

## Try-Me
The try me function is an example which shows you how the program works.

In this scenario, an automatically used URL (oft.at homepage) is searched and all links are collected and returned in a text field.

It is important to note out, that the user cannot enter any URLs here. When you are in the  "Try me out" window, you have 3 different crawl options, which indicate the
depth (Tiefe 1, Tiefe 2).
Once you press one of the "crawl" button, you search links on that specific URL website. 

Always make sure, you start with the right order (1st "Crawl,
2st "Crawl tiefe 1", 3rd "Crawl tiefe 2").

## Simple Search

Reads given URL and crawl the given page.
syntax of ULR must contain ```www.example.domain```

How to use:

Enter your URL and press CRAWL.
You will get an link  in the text field.
