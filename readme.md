# Crawler mmmmmCrawler
This Crawler is using jsoup lib for crawling links from a homepage on a working javafx GUI.

## How to run
Build and run LandingPage ``` src/main/java/at/ac/fhcampuswien/coffescript/mmmmmcrawler/LandingPage.java```

## TryMeOut
The TryMeOut function is an example which shows you how the program works.

In this scenario, an automatically used URL (oft.at homepage) is searched and all links are collected and returned in a text field.

It is important to note out, that the user cannot enter any URLs here. When you are in the  "Try me out" window, you have 3 different crawl options, which indicate the
depth (Tiefe 0, Tiefe 1, Tiefe 2).
Once you press the "crawl" button, you search links on that specific URL website. 
If you like to you can save the result in a JSON file using the button in the lower right corner.

Always make sure, you start with the right order (1st "Crawl,
2st "Crawl tiefe 1", 3rd "Crawl tiefe 2").
